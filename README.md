# google-image-dataset
This repository provided the necessary code to create your own Google Images Dataset in the form of an interactive Jupyter Notebook. Unlike other downloaders, to the best of my knowledge, this method respects [Google's Terms of Service](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66357?hl=en).

This project has been moved to the fastai [repository](https://github.com/fastai/course-v3/blob/master/nbs/dl1/download_images.ipynb).
