# google-image-dataset
This repository provides the necessary code to create your own Google Images Dataset in the form of an interactive Jupyter Notebook. Unlike other downloaders, to the best of my knowledge, this method respects [Google's Terms of Service](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66357?hl=en).

You can see the notebook in nbviewer [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lesscomfortable/google-image-dataset/blob/master/create_dataset.ipynb) or clone the repo to interact with it.

Credits: The tutorial was inspired by Adrian Rosebrock's [tutorial](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/12/04/how-to-create-a-deep-learning-dataset-using-google-images/) and Jeremy Howard contributed to its development.
